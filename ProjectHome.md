Large C++ programs with multiple authors tend to decay and become hard to maintain as the source-base evolves, unless project structure is controlled by strictly enforcing a modular architecture.

The goal of this project is to alleviate this problem by providing tools to analyse the architecture of a C++ program and aid in improving its modularity.
