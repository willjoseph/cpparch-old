
- library for reading/writing unicode files
	- library for interpreting BOM?
	- microsoft implementation if wide iostreams appears broken, STLPort better?
		- e.g. line-ending translation does not work.
	- use boost utf-8 codecvt facet to convert to utf-8?
	
- check for buffer overflow when building paths

- run parser with arguments/environment used to invoke compiler
	- capture environment at point of invoking compiler
		- CL/_CL_/INCLUDE
		- does MSBuild already capture INCLUDE?
	- could filesystem change since compiler invocation?
		- generated source files?
			- unlikely that they would be modified/deleted
	- rewrite include paths to substitute modified stl headers
		- $(VCInstallDir)include -> msvc-8.0/include
		
- unicode support: paths/directories
	- UTF-8 code page 65001?
		- rumour: WriteFile supports only two-byte characters
	- use wide-char win32 calls
