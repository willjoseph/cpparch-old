
- crash: Release, lexer.h, IncludeDependencyNode already declared as non-type
	- intermittent?
	- can't repro


- bug: lookup skipped for name nominated by friend declaration, if called with parameters incorrectly determined to be type-dependent.
	A name nominated by a friend declaration shall be accessible in the scope of the class containing the friend declaration.
	- fails to report error gracefully if lookup fails.
	- how to repro?
	
- leak of global WalkerContext in parseFile
	- currently required so that parse-tree declarations can be used in reporting?
	
- bug: with ALLOCATOR_DEBUG, if type_info is not defined, error parsing malloc.h?
	- attempt repro

	
- bug: using-declaration has wrong source path?
	- std::size_t in <ctime>

- macroPosition is unreliable?
	- attempt repro
	
	
- printer bugs
	- space between *= and &=
	- space before and after =
	- space between return and true/false
	- space between nested > in template decl
