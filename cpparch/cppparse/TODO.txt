	+ findRedeclared should allow member functions, when defining a previously declared member
		* complete original declaration: not necessary unless accessing enclosed scope of function via declaration?
		* look up argument types in context of enclosing template: not required to disambiguate member function declaration?
	+ store declarations by reference, not by value
		+ on redeclaration (or in a using-declaration), redeclare reference to original declaration rather than a copy
	+ preserve information about declarations found during name lookup: required when determining dependencies
		+ for each declaration (or redeclaration) store pointer to previous matching declaration, AND to previous with same name (aka overload)
		+ when finding list of overloads: use list in original declaration
		+ don't overwrite name lookup result with chosen declaration after overload resolution: use last-visible-redeclaration of chosen declaration
		+ using-declaration: store pointer to previous matching declaration (from specified scope!)
	+ remove legacy parameters from FunctionType: contains information about default-arguments
		+ should disregard default-arguments when comparing function types
	+ print cv-qualifiers
	+ implement deferred name-lookup for dependent type-names
	+ print template arguments when printing types
	* prioritise features that improve support for namespace-scope entities, deprioritise class-scope features
		* rationale: dependency on class member requires inclusion of class definition
			* e.g. std::vector<int>::empty() -> std::vector<T> (and all specialisations)
			* e.g. std::iterator_traits<int*> -> std::iterator_traits<T> (and all specialisations)
		* still need to prevent false-positive dependency on namespace-scope entity
		* non-member overloaded operators
		* non-member overload resolution
			* function template argument deduction
		* template instantation
			* overload resolution for dependent names
	* track/report first point in source when a class is required to be complete:
		* required for tracking whether a source-file needs to include a class definition or simply forward-declare
		* e.g. sizeof, member access, direct use as object (except function prototype), base-class
		* same as point-of-instantiation for implicit instantiation
	* print template arguments when linking to template explicit/partial specializations?
		* depending on a specialization implies dependency on all specializations
		* because cannot declare specialization after first instantiation
	* include partial-specialization template-params in anchor, to distinguish from primary template
	* print template arguments when linking to template functions?
	* improve error messages
		* e.g. detect when 'typename' keyword is missing
		* on reportIdentifierMismatch, show the location of the mismatching identifier
	* handle template explicit/partial specialization with empty argument-list
	* friend-declaration (currently behaves like MSVC8, which is broken)
		* refers to name in namespace scope; should not be found by name-lookup (except argument-dependent) until a matching declaration is provided in that namespace scope
			* name-lookup:
				* unqualified: innermost enclosing namespace only
				* qualified (or template-id): 
				* if not found by name lookup (first declaration) is a  member of innermost enclosing namespace, but cannot be found by name-lookup (except argument-dependent?)
				* A function can be defined in a friend declaration of a class if and only if the class is a non-local class (9.8),
					the function name is unqualified, and the function has namespace scope.
				* A friend function defined in a class is in the (lexical) scope of the
					class in which it is defined. A friend function defined outside the class is not (3.4.1).
				* 7.3.1.2-3: If a friend declaration in a nonlocal
				class first declares a class or function the friend class or function is a member of the innermost enclosing
				namespace. The name of the friend is not found by unqualified lookup (3.4.1) or by qualified lookup (3.4.3)
				until a matching declaration is provided in that namespace scope (either before or after the class definition
				granting friendship). If a friend function is called, its name may be found by the name lookup that considers
				functions from namespaces and classes associated with the types of the function arguments (3.4.2). If the
				name in a friend declaration is neither qualified nor a template-id and the declaration is a function or
				an elaborated-type-specifier, the lookup to determine whether the entity has been previously declared shall
				not consider any scopes outside the innermost enclosing namespace.


- refactoring:
	+ replace UniqueTypeId with UniqueType
		+ handle implicit-template-id flag when making unique type
	+ replace getInstantiatedType with makeUniqueType
		+ isDependent
		+ printType/printTypeSequence
		+ addBase
		+ findDeclaration(Bases)
		+ findMemberDeclaration
			* must instantiate base-class in order to look within it, but ignore dependent-base-class
			* if base is not dependent, make-unique
				* enclosing type is instantiated type of class in which lookup occurs
				* finding unique-type for base of Tmpl<T> requires unique-type of Tmpl<T>
				* must pass unique-type into findDeclaration
				* must be able to obtain its parent type for recursion into Scope::parent
				* optimise: cache evaluated base type
			* does the order of declarations affect the type referred to by a base-specifier?
				* base must be defined before it can be used?
			+ check whether isBase param in findDeclaration(Declarations) is still required
			+ unique non-dependent base when parsing base-specifier
				* makeUniqueType seems inconsistent when uniquing dependent bases
					* need to pass D<int> as enclosing-class when base-specifier D:B<T> depends on template parameter
	+ unique all non-dependent type-names/type-ids when parsing
		* base-specifier
		* nested-name-specifier
		* qualified-id
		* template-arguments
		* declarations
		* template-parameters (always dependent!), template-param-defaults
		* forward-declaration
		* destructor-name, conversion-function
		* cast-expression, new-expression, typeid, sizeof
	* rewrite template-parameter scope handling
		* clean up templateParamScope!
			* don't convert it into enclosed scope of class/function
			* instead keep reference to template-param scope within class/function scope
			* search template-param scope before parent scope
		* create 'under-construction' scope?
			* when beginning template-declaration, class-declaration, function-declaration
			* push/clear under-construction scope at point of declaration
	* parser is hard to work with - refactor?
		+ remove unmingled parse
		* combine WalkerContext and ParserContext?
		* remove dead code
		* replace Copied with a list?
			* done mostly, except for addDependent(Dependent)?
		* clean up SimpleDeclarationWalker::deferred
		* naming:
			* ParserContext is lexer?
		* TREEWALKER macros

				* "header3.h" -> c:/project/inc/header3.h -> $include/
				* "../header.h" -> c:/project/src/header.h -> $./
		* how to determine which include-path a source file is rooted in?
		* include-path '.' may override other include-paths?
			* put output files sourced from include-paths into $include subdir
		* use '$..' to indicate looking outside an include-path
	* compare output files generated from same source?
- warn on escaping from include-path using '..'
- track use of completely defined object type
	* note: required for implicit instantiation of template!
		* scenario in which we find unique-type, but does not cause instantation?
			* S<int>* s;
	* definitions:
		* parameter_declaration: void f(T)
		* member_declaration: struct S { T m; };

	* find identifiers that name definitions requiring a complete type
		* add dependency on source file containing definition of type required
		* decorate identifier with link to definition of type?
		* distinguish between complete and incomplete array type
- detect multiple headers with same include-guard
- detect headers that should have an include-guard
- detect order-dependent includes
	* e.g. header1.h depends on header2.h but does not (in)directly include it
		* confused by multiple declarations in different headers: e.g. getwchar in stdio.h and wchar.h
			* prefer (in)directly included source when determining location of declaration
		* confused by #ifndef NULL #define NULL 0 #endif
			* recognise ifndef-define pattern as redeclaration?
				* heuristic is bad
			* tag all declarations within #ifndef X #define X #endif
				* determine all tagged declarations to be present within any file containing #ifndef X
		* confused by #ifdef X X() #endif
			* ignore dependency on X when wrapped in #ifdef X
		* confused by redefining identical macro in different headers
		* confused by forward-declaration of types (or redeclaration of typedef, function?) followed by subsequent include of header
			* only add dependency on complete-type if it is actually used
			* how to track dependency on incomplete type which may be declared in multiple headers?
				* allow if any header containing a redeclaration is (in)directly included
			* the declared identifier in a redeclaration does not depend on the original declaration
				* template explicit/partial specializations depend on the primary declaration via explicitly naming it!
			* forward-declarations using elaborated-type-specifier don't count as redeclarations
				* treat as a redeclaration if used in same scope as original declaration
		* confused by not-yet-resolved name in dependent function-call expression
			* template instantiation required
	* warn if declaration of overloaded function (that would have been selected) occurs after resolution
		* or if similar overload declaration occurs after using-declaration that refers to function name
- detect cyclic includes
- detect unused includes
	* if directly included and not used
		* and all children are not used
	* unused if not directly or indirectly included
- detect missing includes
	* if module A is directly dependent on module B, A should directly include B
- visualise include graph
	* as module dependency graph?
	* module dependency graph not built until after .html

	* show dependencies that are indirect
+ in each output file, add link to original source file
- show point-of-declaration for macros?
- improve formatting of output html
	* enum members on separate line
- list declarations used by each include
	* redeclarations may exist in multiple includes?
		* consider dependency on all redeclarations
		* currently: all overloads of name are listed, used by:
			* findPrimaryTemplate: first non-explicit-specialization (should skip redeclarations)
			* findTemplateSpecialization: specialization matching (should skip redeclarations)
			* copyTemplateParams: after template-declaration, 'overloaded != 0' determines that the definition was previously forward-declared (should ignore explicit-specializations)
			* findBestOverloadedFunction: overload matching
		* at point of declaration, determine if it's a redeclaration, add to redeclaration list
			* or return original declaration?
				* merge template-parameter defaults
				* merge function-parameter defaults
			* for class: if  template parameters (or explicit-specialization template arguments) match
			* for function: if template parameters and function parameters match
			* 13.1-3 [over.load] equivalent parameter list
				+ resolve typedefs
				+ const/volatile ignored
				+ array adjusted to pointer
				+ function adjusted to function-pointer
			* use same comparison as when resolving template-specialization in a declarator-id?
				* no, non-type params are not adjusted in the same way
			* compare type of implicit-object parameter when comparing member function param list
			* can this be determined at point of declaration?

- list symbols depended on by each module
	* use consistent path-separator/root in filenames
		* how does wave derive the absolute root from the relative include-path?
	~ exclude predefined symbols
		~ pass contents of predefined_msvc.h directly to lexer, rather than via #include
	* including macro definitions
	* support overloaded-operators
	* ignore namespace names
	* perform type-dependent name-lookup for template instantiations
	* handle multiple identical typedef/forward-declaration in different modules
	* if symbol is forward-declared, link to primary declaration if visible
			

- use found-include-directive hook to build include-graph
	* doesn't give full path, need to add resolved_include_file
		* or use opened_include_file and compile without BOOST_WAVE_SUPPORT_PRAGMA_ONCE
		* or derive from context and call find_include_file
	* how to uniquely identify a source file?
		* absolute path
	* opened_include_file gives relname/absname
		* always the same?
		* always use forward-slash?
	
- detect mid-declaration-includes

+ output one html per #include
	* why?
		* not required for dependency-tracking?
		* easier to browse html source
		* recognises repeat-includes
		* recognises mid-declaration-includes
	* tag all declarations with the source file?
	* need to track include push/pop
	* emit extra tokens?
		* modify grammar? include-declaration: include declaration-seq eof
		* swallow in lexer?
	* tag first and last token in file?
		* fails if no tokens after #include
	* build include-graph with parent-links, make file-position point at node?
	* append sequence of push/pop commands 'between' tokens?
		* +a = +1
		* -a = -1
		* +a, -a = nothing
		* -a, +a, -a = -1
		* -a, +a = -1, +1
		* -a, +b = -1, +1
		* +a, -a, -b = -1
		* +a, -a, +b = +1
		* +a, +b, -b = +1


- macro dependencies
	* associate macro definitions with source files
	* for each macro expansion, add definition to list of dependencies
			
	
- generate parser
	* point of declaration
		* namespace: after identifier in namespace-declaration
			* contains block-declarations
		* class: after identifier/simple-template-id in class-head, unless anonymous
			* contains template-params, member-declarations
		* enum: after identifier in enum-specifier, unless anonymous

The point of definition of a template is located immediately before its definition. In this example, the
point of definition of the template container is located immediately before the keyword template. Because
the function call f(1) does not depend on a template parameter, the compiler considers names declared before
the definition of the template container. Therefore, the function call f(1) calls f(double). Although f(int)
is a better match, it is not in scope at the point of definition of container.
The point of instantiation of a template is located immediately before the declaration that encloses its use.
In this example, the point of instantiation of container<int> is the location of the explicit instantiation.
Because the qualified function call ::h(arg) depends on the template argument arg, the compiler considers names
declared before the instantiation of container<int>. Therefore, the function call h(arg) calls h(double).
It does not consider h(int), because this function is not in scope at the point of instantiation of container<int>.
Point of instantiation binding implies the following:
A template parameter cannot depend on any local name or class member.
An unqualified name in a template cannot depend on a local name or class member.

- unique types
	+ store function-type as R(A1, A2) rather than just R
	+ store member-function-type as R C::*(A1, A2) rather than just R
	+ store member-pointer-type as R C::* rather than just R
	+ issue: unique type reference to function-param-scope left dangling: because gUniqueTypes not cleared between files!
	+ more optimal implementation of isDependent: each Type refers to the outermost enclosing template that it depends on
	+ cv-qualifiers
	* deferred evaluation of dependent-type
- argument-dependent-lookup
- name-lookup for overloaded-operators


argument dependent lookup
3.4.2-2
For each argument type T in the function call, there is a set of zero or more associated namespaces and a
set of zero or more associated classes to be considered. The sets of namespaces and classes is determined
entirely by the types of the function arguments (and the namespace of any template template argument).
Typedef names and using-declarations used to specify the types do not contribute to this set. The sets of
namespaces and classes are determined in the following way:
— If T is a fundamental type, its associated sets of namespaces and classes are both empty.
— If T is a class type (including unions), its associated classes are: the class itself; the class of which it is a
member, if any; and its direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces are the namespaces
of which its associated classes are members. Furthermore, if T is a class template specialization,
its associated namespaces and classes also include: the namespaces and classes associated with the
types of the template arguments provided for template type parameters (excluding template template
parameters); the namespaces of which any template template arguments are members; and the classes
of which any member templates used as template template arguments are members. [ Note: non-type
template arguments do not contribute to the set of associated namespaces.—end note ]
— If T is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is the namespace in which it is defined. If it is
class member, its associated class is the member’s class; else it has no associated class.
— If T is a pointer to U or an array of U, its associated namespaces and classes are those associated with
U.
— If T is a function type, its associated namespaces and classes are those associated with the function
parameter types and those associated with the return type.
— If T is a pointer to a member function of a class X, its associated namespaces and classes are those
associated with the function parameter types and return type, together with those associated with X.
— If T is a pointer to a data member of class X, its associated namespaces and classes are those associated
with the member type together with those associated with X.


class member lookup
3.4.1-8
A name used in the definition of a member function (9.3) of class X following the function’s declarator-id 28
or in the brace-or-equal-initializer of a non-static data member (9.2) of class X shall be declared in one of
the following ways:
— before its use in the block in which it is used or in an enclosing block (6.3), or
— shall be a member of class X or be a member of a base class of X (10.2), or
— if X is a nested class of class Y (9.7), shall be a member of Y, or shall be a member of a base class of Y
(this lookup applies in turn to Y’s enclosing classes, starting with the innermost enclosing class),29 or
— if X is a local class (9.8) or is a nested class of a local class, before the definition of class X in a block
enclosing the definition of class X, or
— if X is a member of namespace N, or is a nested class of a class that is a member of N, or is a local class
or a nested class within a local class of a function that is a member of N, before the use of the name,
in namespace N or in one of N ’s enclosing namespaces.
